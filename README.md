# NER-of-ADR- Classifier-in-tweets
 Algorithm for implementing the classifier on tweets
 
<p>Based on the training received (see step 3), the trained algorithm was applied to a database of approximately 9.571 thousand tweets. At this stage, the CRF model built and trained was able to automatically identify 2,842 posts with the presence of Drug and/or ADR entities.</p>
<p>The CRF model presented satisfactory results for recognizing named entities, clearly showing that it is possible to explore new ways of collecting information in the field of pharmacovigilance, not aiming to replace the traditional method. The performance figures presented could be improved by using other techniques, such as recurrent neural networks, deep learning, as well as by increasing the number of examples used to train the algorithm. However, we consider the techniques and results presented to be promising, see the next step (part 5).  </p>

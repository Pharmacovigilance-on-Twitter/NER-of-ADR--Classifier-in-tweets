# NER-of-ADR- Classifier-in-tweets
 Algorithm for implementing the classifier in tweets
 
<p>Based on the training received (see step 3), the trained algorithm was applied to a database with approximately 9.571 thousand tweets. At this stage, the CRF model built and trained was able to automatically identify 2.842 posts with the presence of Drug and/or ADR entities.</p>
<p>The CRF model presented satisfactory results for the recognition of named entities, clearly showing that it is possible to explore new ways to gather information in the field of pharmacovigilance. The performance values presented can be improved through the use of other techniques, such as recurrent neural networks, as well as increasing the number of examples used for training the algorithm, however, the techniques and results presented are promising, see the next step (part 5). </p>
